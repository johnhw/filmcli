        A blade runner must pursue and try to terminate four replicants who stole a
        ship in space and have returned to Earth to find their creator.

        Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's
        mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time. A visually
        remarkable, achingly human sci-fi masterpiece.
